# iris-flower-classification

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using Python.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal is to predict the species of the iris flower based on these features.

## Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model training (using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or SVM)
- Model evaluation with accuracy and classification report
- Visualization of results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
